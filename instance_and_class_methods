What is a class method?

A class method is a method that is called upon a Class. For example:

class = Class.new

In this example .new is the class method that is acting on the Class class.

What is an instance method?

An instance method is a method that can only be called upon an instance of a Class. For example:

class.instance_method

In this example, we are taking the class instance we instantiated previously and instance_method is our instance method that is acting on the instance class.

One final example that puts the two together:

class Computer

def self.keyboard #====> This defines a new class method of Computer
puts ‘I type things’ 
end

def mouse #====> This defines a new instance method for Computer that can be called upon an instance of Computer
puts ‘I move your cursor’
end

end
